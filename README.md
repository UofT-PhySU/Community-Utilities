# Community-Utilities

An open-source repository of practical tools contributed by the fantastic PhySU community.

## Read this before use

This repository is created to curate some QoL (Quality of Life) scripts that <ins>***are not directly related to homework***.</ins> For example, something that generates LaTeX tables from .csv files for general lab reports is okay, but a numerical integrator that resembles a PHY407 homework assignment is not. To prevent you or your peers from accidentally committing academic offenses (AO), please make a new branch of this repository so admins can review your submission before merging it into the `main` branch. See more on [how to use GitHub](https://github.com/UofT-PhySU?view_as=public).
